# Wave-Watch
Proposal. 
Background: 
Wave watch is a project that helps surfers of all skill level check out the forecast for their favorite surf spot around Santa Cruz and Capitola. Users will be present a map of the bay and given 5 locations that they can choose from. 
Upon choosing the location they are interested in, a graph will pop up which presents them with the weather, tide level, and wind intensity associated with the spot. In addition, users will be able to close out the location to bring up information on a second location, allowing them to compare the two. 

In wave watch , users will be able to:

  - Click on an interactive map to choose a surf spot
  - Pulls up graph that shows locations weather, tide level, wind intensity(?)
  - Exit out of aaid graphic to choose another
  - Able to compare the two clocked locations if desired. 

In addition, this project will include:

  - An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
  - An instruction README

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

  - D3 library
  - Marine API (https://stormglass.io/)
